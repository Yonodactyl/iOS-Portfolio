## Knight Spots
#### Frameworks Used
`UIKit` `Core Animation`

Knight Spots is a passion project of mine that I had since starting my journey at the University of Central Florida. Noticing the plethora of students (and the limitation of the parking spots) I decided to try and help my fellow knights on campus in finding parking a little easier. Since the school already manages sensors at the garages I was able to recieve this data and parse it and create a ready to digest application for iOS.
